		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p> Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: ENFJ-T </p>
    <p> | Passionate | Resilient | Boundless | </p>
	  <break>
		<p>
			 Hello there! My name is Rhian (think of Rihanna, not Ryan) and I am currently an undergrad at the University of California, Irvine, studying Informatics in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and minoring in Digital Arts and Digital Filmmaking under the Claire Trevor School of the Arts.
		</p>
		<break>
		<p>
			Having been raised in a very driven household, I take every responsibility handed to me very seriously and seek to make sure everything I do is accomplished timely and with the utmost care. I have an immense passion for culture and the arts, constantly broadening my knowledge and challenging my idea of the western norm.
		</p>
		<break>
			<p>
				I have been working around technology from a young age and am passionate about continuing my education in the field. I look forward to furthering my skills and building a long-lasting career in the Computer Software and Film Media industries.

		<p>
			Chosen to be the Commercials Coordinator for UCI's 38th Annual Pilipinx-American Culture Night, I, alongside my Co-Coordinator, was commissioned to make a commercial for the Seafood City Supermarket. After the production, Seafood City bought our video and it is currently being aired on the TFC Network.

		<div style="text-align: center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxkk1JCDNtU?rel=0" frameborder="2" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
		<p>
			I work closely with my clients in order to understand fully what aesthetic fits their vision. One client who I've been working with for the past year has been Ashley Parker, a Sacramento based stylist. This video is one of many Lookbooks I have filmed for her, and it still remains both of ours favorite.
