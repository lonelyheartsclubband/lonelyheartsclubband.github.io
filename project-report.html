            User Interviews were vital in figuring out what users of my portfolio were looking for. The interviews conducted consisted of questions asking what makes portfolios memorable both in content and design.

            The Competitor Analysis helped give a better idea as to what otheres were creating. It also gave some inspiration as to layout ideas and content deliverables. The specific portfolios I analyzed were portfolios presenting similar content to mine.

            The Feature Value Matrix displayed the features that were requested most based off of the user interviews and competitor analysis. I selected these features because they were what my user interviews valued most as well as what I saw repeatedly through my competitor analysis.

          <p>
            I prioritized these features based on how much my user interviews valued the feature and whether or not I found it made the experience on my competitor's portfolios more memorable. It was incorporated into building the interface by clearly displaying which features should be implemented first in order to satisfy the users.

            User stories help provide reason to the Feature Value Matrix by analyzing why a specific user might want to see that feature implemented. I arrived at creating these user stories by looking at my Feature Value Matrix, then going through my portfolio to see how it's implementation added to the experience of my portfolio.

        <div class="text-block">
          <p>
            The Cognitive Walkthroughs consisted of watching users navigate through my portfolio in real time and anayzing what they did as well as noting their thoughts. It was important because it showed aspects of my portfolio that, to me, were intuitive, but to others not as much. The main hallenge conducting these walkthroughs was having interviewees who had little to say about certain features and therefore, making it difficult to understand where to go from my first design, only knowing the interviewees did want some sort of change.

          <p>
            I conducted a Question Test and Navigation Test. The most difficult challenge was having users take the test in general with one of the test having zero responses for quite sometime. The test results showed my links were not as visible as they should have been, making navigation not as intuitive.
