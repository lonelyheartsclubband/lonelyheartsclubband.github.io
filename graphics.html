            This graphic was created as an advertisement for UCI's Pilipinx-American Culture Night to display the dance practice times for each dance within the Rural Suite. When creating the concept for this design, I decided on going with something extremely simple with little to no detail in order to portray the simplicity of the Rural Suite (the Rural Suite consists of dances that originate from the farmlands and are meant to represent the simple modest life of farmers). I grabbed a sketchbook and drew out iconic moves of each dance, using only simple lines and curves. After sketching them out, I scanned it to my laptop and imported into Adobe Photoshop. I cleaned up the sketeches and added a red drop shadow because the costumes of the Suite are predominantly red. I finished with adding blue, red, and yellow accent colors to represent the Philippines Flag.

            In my 3rd year at UC Irvine, I worked as a UX Designer in a project group called The Remedy. The project was a website and VR simulation for a program titled: "Therapy VR." This GIF is from the VR Demo I created. Because this project had to be completed in the span of 10 weeks, we created this Demo to showcase what it would look like in 3 years once we get enough funding and support. I built this VR Demo completely on Adobe After Effects, building a 360 world from some photos of galaxies I found online. After building the world, I placed in 2D text blocks that hovered in the space. I utilized a cool-toned palette and easy listening audio to further "Therapy" setting and ensure the user would be at ease and relaxed.

            This GIF is from a tutorial video I created for my studio - Antmedia Studios. The video is a safety training video for the Operations Crew at the UC Irvine Student Center and Event Services. In the video, they are shown how to properly handle certain equipment. I built the entire intro video on Adobe After Effects. For this certain screen, I wanted to create icons that were siloutte-esque. This way, the different equpiment were easily recognizable, but still simply designed so they looked uniform when put together. A voice over states the name of each title, which is when each icon expands accordingly.
